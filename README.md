A Leiningen plugin that provides support for importing Maven "Bill Of Materials" (BOM) dependencies.

## Usage

FIXME: Use this for user-level plugins:

Put `[lein-bom "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your `:user`
profile.

FIXME: Use this for project-level plugins:

Put `[lein-bom "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your project.clj.

FIXME: and add an example usage that actually makes sense:

    $ lein bom
